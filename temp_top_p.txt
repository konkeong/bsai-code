temperature | number or null | Optional | Defaults to 1
What sampling `temperature` to use, between 0 and 2.
Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random,
while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.
`temperature` refers to how tokens are selected, with a range
from 0.0 to 2.0, where 2.0 indicates very high variability

top_p | number or null | Optional | Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with `temperature`, called nucleus sampling,
where the model considers the results of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass.
So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.
"radius of filter mesh to allow items to pass through"
`top_p` range from 0.0 to 1.0
0.1 means "consider the most relevant tokens" (narrow scope)
1.0 means "don't filter tokens at all (wide scope)

`top_p` really changes the selection set for the data and not the variability of the data the way `temperature` does.
